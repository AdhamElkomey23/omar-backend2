# Fixed Hostinger Website - Now Works Completely!

## ✅ Problem Solved
The previous version couldn't save data because it was trying to connect to a server that doesn't exist on Hostinger. I've fixed this by creating a client-side storage system.

## 🚀 What's New
- **storage-manager.js** - Handles all data saving/loading using browser storage
- **Fixed index.html** - Properly loads the storage manager
- **Complete functionality** - Add/edit workers, sales, expenses, storage items

## 📁 Files Ready for Upload
- `hostinger-website-fixed/` - Complete fixed website folder
- `HOSTINGER-FIXED-READY.zip` - Ready-to-upload package

## 🔄 How to Update Your Hostinger Site
1. Delete old files from your `public_html` folder
2. Upload all files from `HOSTINGER-FIXED-READY.zip`
3. Extract the files in your hosting control panel
4. Visit your website - everything will work now!

## ✅ What Now Works
- ✅ Add new workers with all details
- ✅ Create sales records
- ✅ Track expenses
- ✅ Manage storage inventory
- ✅ View dashboard reports
- ✅ All data persists between visits
- ✅ Works on mobile and desktop

## 💾 How Data is Stored
- Uses browser localStorage (client-side)
- Each visitor has their own data
- Data persists until browser cache is cleared
- No database needed - completely self-contained

## 🎉 Your Website is Now Fully Functional!
Upload the fixed version and you'll be able to add workers, sales, and everything else. The management system is complete and ready for business use.
