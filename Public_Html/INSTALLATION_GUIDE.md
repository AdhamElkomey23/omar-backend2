$username = 'u179479756_newomarapp';
$password = '#sS9ei3lK+';
```

```

### Step 3: Database Import
1. In Hostinger control panel, go to phpMyAdmin

### Common Issues:

1. **Database Connection Failed**
   - Double-check database credentials in all PHP files
   - Ensure database exists in Hostinger
   - Verify database user has proper permissions

2. **API Endpoints Return 404**
   - Ensure `.htaccess` file is uploaded
   - Check that mod_rewrite is enabled (usually enabled on Hostinger)
   - Verify API files are in the `api/` folder

3. **CORS Errors**
   - All API files already include proper CORS headers
   - If issues persist, add your domain to CORS origin

4. **Mobile Menu Not Working**
   - Ensure JavaScript is enabled
   - Check `assets/app.js` is properly loaded

### Getting Support:
If you encounter any issues:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Check server error logs in Hostinger control panel
3. Verify all files uploaded correctly
4. Test API endpoints individually using browser/Postman

## File Permissions
Most files should have standard permissions:
- PHP files: 644
- Directories: 755
- .htaccess: 644

Hostinger typically sets these automatically.
