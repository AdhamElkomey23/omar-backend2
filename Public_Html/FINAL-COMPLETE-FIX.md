## Upload Instructions

Upload ALL files from `_public_html/` folder to your Hostinger public_html directory.

The key fixed files:
- `api/sales.php` - Fixed POST and DELETE
- `api/expenses.php` - Fixed POST and DELETE
- `api/storage.php` - Fixed DELETE (already working)

## Expected Results

After uploading:
- Sales page: ADD and DELETE will work
- Expenses page: ADD and DELETE will work
- Storage page: DELETE will work (ADD already working)
- All operations will have proper error handling
- Error logs will help identify any remaining issues

## If Issues Persist

Check your Hostinger error logs for specific database or PHP errors. The enhanced logging will show exactly what's failing.

All functionality should now work properly with comprehensive error handling and validation.
